# DayTrader 3: WebSphere → Spring Boot modernization "before" estate

This fork is prepared as the starting point for a WebSphere (Liberty / synthetic tWAS on AIX) → Spring Boot on AWS ECS Fargate migration demo.

```bash
make up && make build && make run && make parity TARGET=http://localhost:9083/daytrader
```

The original README follows.

## Spring Boot migration scaffold

The standalone `daytrader-boot/` project is built with Java 21 and keeps the existing Liberty baseline unchanged:

```bash
make boot-build
make boot-run
curl -s http://localhost:8080/daytrader/actuator/health
make parity TARGET=http://localhost:8080/daytrader
make boot-stop
```

Pass `MVN_SETTINGS=/path/to/settings.xml` to `make boot-build` or `make boot-run` when Maven needs a mirror. See [the scaffold README](daytrader-boot/README.md) for details.

# Java EE6: DayTrader3 Sample

Java EE6 DayTrader3 Sample


This sample contains the DayTrader 3 benchmark, which is an application built around the paradigm of an online stock trading system. The application allows users to login, view their portfolio, lookup stock quotes, and buy or sell stock shares. With the aid of a Web-based load driver such as Apache JMeter, the real-world workload provided by DayTrader can be used to measure and compare the performance of Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application servers offered by a variety of vendors. In addition to the full workload, the application also contains a set of primitives used for functional and performance testing of various Java EE components and common design patterns.

DayTrader is an end-to-end benchmark and performance sample application. It provides a real world Java EE workload. 

## Getting Started

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself:
* [Building and running on the command line using Maven and Gradle](/docs/Using-cmd-line.md)
* [Building and running using Eclipse and WebSphere Development Tools (WDT)](/docs/Using-WDT.md)
* [Downloading WAS Liberty](/docs/Downloading-WAS-Liberty.md)

Once the server has been started, go to [http://localhost:9083/daytrader](http://localhost:9083/daytrader) to interact with the sample.
